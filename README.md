The project related to transactional SQL involved designing and implementing a database schema, as well as various SQL operations and functionalities.

To begin, we created a database schema by defining the structure and relationships of the required tables. This was done using Data Definition Language (DDL) statements, which included specifying attributes, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints for each table.

Following the schema creation, we performed Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations to manipulate the data within the tables. These operations included inserting, updating, and deleting data to populate the tables with relevant information and ensure data integrity throughout the project.

In addition to basic database operations, we developed complex queries involving multiple tables, join operations, aggregations, and conditional statements. These queries allowed us to retrieve specific data based on various criteria, enabling us to gain meaningful insights and answer business or analytical questions.

To enhance the functionality of the database, we implemented triggers. Triggers are database objects that automatically execute actions in response to specific events, such as insertions, updates, or deletions in the tables. By utilizing triggers, we enforced additional business rules, maintained data consistency, and performed necessary actions whenever specific events occurred.

We also utilized cursors in the creation of procedures. Cursors allow iterative processing of query results, enabling us to retrieve and process data row by row, perform calculations or transformations, and execute specific actions based on the retrieved data.

Furthermore, we developed functions, which are reusable blocks of code that return a value based on input parameters. These functions were designed to perform specific calculations, transformations, or data manipulations, simplifying complex operations and improving code modularity. They could be called from queries, procedures, or triggers.

In summary, the project involved designing a transactional SQL database schema and implementing it through DDL statements. We performed DML operations to manipulate data, created complex queries for data retrieval, implemented triggers for automated actions, and utilized cursors and functions to enhance functionality. Detailed documentation, including the ER model, relational data model, SQL scripts, and explanations of these artifacts, will be provided.
